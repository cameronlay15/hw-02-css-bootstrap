# hw-02-css-bootstrap
This is a project in which I created an online profile on myself based on using Boot Strap CSS formatting options. We were provided with png pictures to work off of in order to try and immitate the existing styles and functionality. We also were to utilize the Boot Strap Grid in order to properly create containers, rows, and columns for formatting.  

# Installation

I pulled the png files from Github from the gt-atl-fsf-ft-08-2020 repo. The remainder of the formatting was from Boot Strap including forms, buttons, nav bars, etc. 

# Usage
The profile has an about me page, a portfolio page, and a contact page all of which should be linked to each other.
